Introduction:

Education is a crucial element in society, and the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted student performance.
This project aims to analyze historical student records to identify factors affecting academic success and develop predictive models.
Motivation:

There is a pressing need for innovative solutions to improve educational quality and reduce failure rates.
The project leverages machine learning to analyze student data and provide actionable insights.
Problem Statement:

The project aims to classify students based on their likelihood of passing exams using various classifiers (KNN, SVM).
Key objectives include:
Predicting student success.
Identifying the most effective classifiers.
Understanding factors influencing student performance.
Dataset Processing:

Mapping Categorical Data:

Convert categorical strings to numerical values for model training.
Example: Mapping mother's job to numerical values.
Feature Scaling:

Normalize the range of independent variables to improve algorithm performance.
Dataset Visualization:

Utilize Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize data patterns and correlations.
Techniques include:
Distribution histograms.
Boxplots for variable distribution.
Correlation matrices.
Model Evaluation Metrics:

Confusion Matrix
F1 Score
ROC Curve
ROC Score
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Simple implementation, robust to noise, but computationally expensive.
Steps include data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, fitting, and predicting.
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Utilizes kernel tricks for classification.
Evaluates performance using different kernels (linear, polynomial, Gaussian).
Results Summary:

KNN Results:

Training time, accuracy, F1 score, and ROC metrics evaluated.
SVM Results:

Comparison of linear, polynomial, and Gaussian kernels.
Best performance observed with the linear kernel.
Factors Affecting Student Performance:

Positive Factors:

Parents' education, guardian involvement, motivation for higher education, study time, and parents' job status.
Negative Factors:

Age, health issues, social activities, absences, and previous failures.
Conclusion:

The project successfully identifies key factors influencing student performance and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in educational contexts.
Recommendations for students, parents, and educational institutions are provided to enhance academic success.
